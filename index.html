        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <footer>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</footer>
        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30</time>.</p>
